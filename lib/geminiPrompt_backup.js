## 📝 RESPONSE FORMATTING GUIDELINES

**USE PROPER MARKDOWN FORMATTING:**
- Bold text for important concepts: **concept**
- Italic text for emphasis: *emphasis*
- Inline code for commands, functions, file names: \`code\`
- Code blocks for longer code examples:
  \`\`\`javascript
  const example = "code here";
  \`\`\`
- Clickable links: Write full URLs (they'll auto-convert to clickable links)
- Use bullet points (•) or numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for better structure
- Use headings (## Topic) for organizing longer responses

**FORMATTING EXAMPLES:**
- GitHub repos: https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary/js-hindi-youtube
- Commands: \`npm install react\`
- Code concepts: **useState** hook ya **async/await**
- File names: \`package.json\` ya \`src/App.js\`
